// A function looks something like this
/*
    <return_type> identifier(<parameter_type_1> parameter_name_1, ...){
        
        // DO STUFF
        
        return <whatever_we_want_to_return>;
    }
    
    if return type is "void" we do not need to return anything
    but we can use "return;" to exit the function
    
    we can call the function like 
       identifier();  // function without parameters
       identifier(foo, bar, ...);  // function with parameters
    where foo and bar are variables of the type of the parameters.
*/

// A variable is declared like this
/*
   <type> identifier;
   identifier = <something of type <type>>;
   
   <type> identifier = <something of type <type>>;
   
   <type> identifier = function_with_right_return_type();
*/

// the "auto" keyword
/*

auto can be used to let the compiler automatically determine the type of a variable.
For instance if a function returns an int, then the variable holding the return value can only be an int

int get_int(){
    return 0;
}
auto a = get_int();  // a is an integer

You might want to use the actual type to avoid mistakes and improve readability.
Especially in a large code base it might not be clear what the type is if you use auto
*/

/*
void hello(){
    std::cout << "hello" << "\n";

Why does it not work? 
  The C++ compiler needs to know that the function exists BEFORE it gets called.
  It does, however, not need to know what exactly it does.
  That is why we only need to know the DECLARATION of the function but not the DEFINITION.
  One often seperates declaration and definition into HEADER (.h, .hpp, ...) and SOURCE (.cpp) files respectively.
  Then we only need to include the header file, so the compiler knows that the function exists and can check,
  that the definition matches the way we call the function.

//********************************** OBJECTS, MEMORY AND POINTERS *********************************

// #include <iostream>
// #include <string>

/*
// In C++, like in Java, we have primitive data types like int, float, double, char, bool, ...
// and more complex ones, which are objects. Objects are instances of classes. For instance, to represent 
// some kind of text, we can use the "string" class from the standard library -> "std::string"

std::string text = "This is text";

// In this case, C++ automatically converts the right side of the = to an instance of std::string.
// This does not work for every type. Most times, we have to explicitly call the constructor of a class.
//E.g. :

std::string text = std::string("This is text");

// Note: we did not use the operator "new" in this case! This is different to Java, where we always use it if
// we do not have a primitive data type. "new" has another meaning in C++.

std::string* text_pointer = new std::string("This is text");
// std::cout << text_pointer;

// When you print "text_pointer" to console, you will get something like this: 0x55f797c84eb0
// This is the memory address of the string object we created with new.
// So "new" does not give us the object, but a literal POINTER to the place in memory where out object is.
// That this is a pointer can be seen by the "*" next to std::string*.
// This is called a "raw" pointer and in modern C++ we ususally do not use it anymore. We use "smart" pointers,
// but this is not relevant right now.

// To access the object at the end of this pointer, we need to DEREFERENCE it again. This can be done with the "*".
// std::cout << *text_pointer;

// As C++ does not manage memory usage like Java does. Everything that was once created with a new has to be deleted again
// when we are done with the object to avoid that our program hogs memory it does not use anymore.
// Java does this automatically and deletes unreferenced objects by running a garbage collection from time to time.

delete text_pointer;
text_pointer = nullptr;

// the nullptr is the so called null pointer. It points to an invalid memory address and is used to invalidate a pointer.
// Because even though we deleted the object at the end of the pointer, the pointer itself still points to the memory address
// Try this:
int main(int argc, char *argv[]){

    std::string* text_pointer = new std::string("This is text");

    std::cout << text_pointer << "\n";  // output: 0x559c67a9deb0
    
    delete text_pointer;                // delete string object
    
    std::cout << text_pointer;          // output is still: 0x559c67a9deb0

    return 0;
}

// We can see that the output is the same before and after the delete. In contrast, this will break:
int main(int argc, char *argv[]){

    std::string* text_pointer = new std::string("This is text");

    std::cout << *text_pointer << "\n";  // output: This is text

    delete text_pointer;                 // delete string object

    std::cout << *text_pointer;          // [1]    31776 segmentation fault (core dumped)

    return 0;
}

// As we can see, we could not access the actual object anymore.
// This managing of memory access in large programs is one of the things that are very difficult in C++.
// Smart pointers help with that because they can manage memory better.

// So why use C++ and pointers when it is so hard to manage the memory correctly?
//
// Mainly because this gives the programmer the freedom to decide what get created and deleted when and
// how data is passed around. Because of this, C++ programs are usually used when performance is critical.
// They can be optimized to the last bit, so to speak.
//
// The main advantage of pointers are that they can be passed to functions instead of the object.
// This means, we do not have to pass a potentially large object, which requires copying, which would negatively
// impact performance.



// Instead of using pointers, we can also use REFERENCES
// A reference can never be uninitialized and it can never be null. We also do not have to dereference it to use it.

// std::string& no_text; <- does not work

// We can basically use it like if we had the object itself. The benefit is, we can still edit the underlying object.

void populate_string(std::string* s_pointer){

    // This checks if the pointer is a nullptr.
    // If it is a nullpointer, we cannot assign a value to it
    if(s_pointer){
        *s_pointer = std::string("The pointer string");
